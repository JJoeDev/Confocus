# Confocus
Console focus application

Confocus is meant to be a simple CLI focusing application. It is here to remind you to take a short break from what you are currently working on

## Why CLI

I decided to make it CLI because it has been quite a while since I have been working with the console.

## Cross platform?

I will personally do my best to make it cross platform with Linux and Windows. I don't like mac and don't own one so yea.
